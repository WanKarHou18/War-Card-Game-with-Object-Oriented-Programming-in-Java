# War-Card-Game-with-Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java
This project is focusing on creating a WAR Card Game with Object Oriented Programming in Java. This card game is played using a standard 52-card deck which has (13 ranks of 4 suits). 

<h>Game Description</h>
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down, in front of him. Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack. If the cards are the same rank, it is War, player saying "W - A - R" and each player turns up three card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (ten cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, then return all the card to each player. The game continues until one player has all the cards and wins. If you don't have enough cards to complete the war, you lose. If neither player has enough cards, the one who runs out first loses. If both run out simultaneously, it's a draw.
